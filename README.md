### How I Use AI in Engineering

- AI-assisted code generation and refactoring  
- Automated test scaffolding and documentation support  
- Architecture exploration and performance optimization suggestions  
- Debugging assistance across full-stack systems  
- Productivity acceleration while maintaining manual review standards  

I use AI tools as productivity accelerators, not replacements, ensuring all generated code follows clean architecture principles, security standards, and production-ready practices.
